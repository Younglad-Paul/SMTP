This is a basic Mailing system using NodeMailer.

To view run the index.html using liveserver and run the index.js using "node index.js". 

To get desird result turn on your google account "2-step verification" and then generate an "App passwords" which is to be used for "EMAIL_PASS" in the env file.
This is neccessary due to the fact that using your normal gmail password will not be acceptable by nodemailer thus returning a function rejection error.
